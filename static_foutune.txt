[1] The number one fortune stick of the oracle
Signify a time of turbulence when dragons and tigers meet
Rising up high with great pride
Stride at leisure in the Imperial Palace of the sky #
[2] The withered trunks flourish again in Spring
The butterflies are attracted by the fragrance of the blossom and the lush greeneries
The peach paradise is full of vibrant colours
What a chance discovery for a small fishing boat!  #
[3] The trees on Cattle Mountain produced excellent wood
What a pity they were excessively cut down
Machineries & equipments might be huge in their sizes
Only accurate measurements in small details will produce the right joineries in wooden crafts #
[4] The swallow nurses her chicks below the eaves of the roof
She whispers and murmurs all morning till noon
She comes and goes, flies high and low
Her flights take her through the green foliage of willows #
[5] It was a wild windy night at the eastern courtyard
The vibrant colours were sweep away from the flowers
It is fortunate there is someone who pity for the flower
Rising early, she tends to the roots bringing a new life to the garden #
[6] Sailing on a lone boat over thousands of miles
Coming home to a welcome with with music and wine
What a joy it was to meet old friends
To talk about everything and anything under the sun  #
[7] Wild geese are flying south in autumn time
Trees in the courtyard are turning red with falling leaves
The sound of washing winter clothes from afar is dry and piercing
The maple trees by the fishing shore are turning into a fiery red #
[8] The magpie is chased out of her nest by the tooting turtledove
An unhappy affair for both the host and the guest
Mistletoes should climb on pine trees in the mountain
Let's figure out the meaning behind all this #
[9] Playing a new melody with a jade harp
Letting in the fresh breeze along with the moonlight
Gathering friends to share the delight of the chrysanthemum blossom
To sing and dance and to savour good wine #
[10] The full moon hangs brightly in the sky
Sometimes it might be blocked from view by the clouds
When will her bright light shine through again?
May be someone will lend her a whirlwind to clear the clouds? #
[11] The willow hangs over the waterfront like a green mist
The day is long enough to take a nap or two or even three
The swallows come and go as if they are dancing in the air
Feel the breeze and treasure this beautiful scenery #
[12] The city in the mirage might seem boundless
The pillars might seem tall and reach the sky
All can be shattered by a gust of wind
Some of it might linger on in the suspense of a smoky mist #
[13] The plum flower blossom early in the Southern Mountain
The crystal-like petals would melt in the wine
The rider on a donkey would arrive early
Watching a child carrying it on his back, the pulm is the most beautiful splendour in Spring time #
[14] Planting bamboo trees for a spiritual seclusion
Such a joy to stay in the straw hut watching the rain drizzles in the Spring
And lay beside the apricot blossoms intoxicated
The only nuisance is the songs of nightingales stirring in a dream so sweet #
[15] Drifting along the stream on a magical bamboo raft
Travelling all over the Imperial Palace inside the Moon
Fairies dress in rainbow colours singing from afar
Time is boundless with wine and verses #
